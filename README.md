### Sales Tracking System
###### Application Instructions :bookmark_tabs:

A multi-purpose store has multiple branches around the state, and every branch has many salespeople. After every work shift, the sales manager wants to know the average sale of the salespeople to separate them based on their selling skills into three groups:
- high level
- mediocre level
- low level

Then they announce the best seller at the end of the day.
###### Customer Requirements :pushpin:

1. The program must be running the whole time unless I'd want to exit.
2. The manager should be able to address how many salespersons I have each day and then enter their information.
3. The application must show the average amount of sales per seller.
4. The app has to show the best seller according to the sum of their invoice amounts.

7. Low-level sellers, sell a maximum amount of 500$, mediocre-level around 500-1000$, and high-level sellers have more than 1000$ sales. :money_with_wings:
